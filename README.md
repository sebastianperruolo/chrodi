A Chrome App wrapper for Kodi web UI

## Installation
If you want to install this Chrome App please go to the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kodi-chrome-app/dachpjcniijcophipfcedfiafioajkne)

## Why?

I own a Chromebook which I use to remote control my Kodi. The web UI is the first thing I started to use, I really love [Chorus](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Chorus). Then I installed [Kassi - Kodi/XBMC Remote Controlmjp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kassi-kodixbmc-remote-con/jgannjdjlpnoibphpbmmfjkejcfhc) and [Play to Kodi](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/play-to-kodi/fncjhcjfnnooidlkijollckpakkebden). Those utility tools are very good but I wanted something that behaves like an app, like my iPhone remote control.

Chrome Apps are like native apps on ChromeOS, Ubuntu... Windows... Mac, I guess. So (I thought) this is what I want, a native remote control that will run on my Chromebook and on my Ubuntu laptop. But then I estimated the work needed so I gave up, it was going to be a really long project.

[Insert idea sound here]

What if I wrap Chorus, the web UI, in a Chrome App? [Chrodi](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kodi-chrome-app/dachpjcniijcophipfcedfiafioajkne) happens, a native client that will show you the web ui you enabled.

It is the first version and it need some work, but if someone like to give it a try, I'm eager to have some feedback.
